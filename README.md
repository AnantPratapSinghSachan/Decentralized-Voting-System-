# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description
The Decentralized Voting System is a secure, transparent, and trustless voting platform built on blockchain. It enables anyone to vote on a list of proposals while ensuring that each participant votes only once.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to empower democratic decision-making in organizations, communities, and DAOs by leveraging blockchain's transparency and immutability. This system eliminates centralized control and ensures fair vote counting without manipulation.

## Key Features
- Proposal creation at contract deployment
- One-person-one-vote enforcement
- Transparent vote counting
- Public read-access to proposal and vote data
- Admin-agnostic functionality (no privileged control after deployment)

## Future Scope
- Add time-based voting windows
- Enable proposal creation by users
- Integrate ERC-20 token-weighted voting
- Front-end integration for ease of access
- Off-chain vote result notification or webhook integration
